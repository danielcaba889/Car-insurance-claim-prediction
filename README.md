# Car-insurance-claim-prediction
Data science project to predict car insurance claims

The main purpose of this project is to achieve an extense analysis of the dataset - Car insurance claim prediction - provided by Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifteshanajnin/carinsuranceclaimprediction-classification?select=sample_submission.csv)

The Dataset contains information on policyholders having the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, 
the population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc, and the target variable indicating whether 
the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.

A ML model will be trained on a training set, in order to predict whether a new policyholder with similar attributes will file a claim.
